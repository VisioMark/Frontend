# Format to follow when pushing to the repo ðŸ“Œ

- Always branch out from the main branch unless you are working on a feature that is not yet merged to the main branch. And also create an issue of what you are working on if it is not yet created.
- Create a branch with the name of the feature you are working on (e.g. `feature/landing-page`)
  - If it is a bug fix, use `bugfix/bug-name` (e.g. `bugfix/landing-page`)
    `NB: Do not use the same branch for multiple features. Create a new branch for each feature.`
- Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message
- Push to the branch and create a pull request to the main branch
- Assign someone to review your code. If there is merge conflict, resolve it and then wait for the reviewer to approve your pull request.
- If PR is approved, Fronted team lead will merge the PR to the main branch.

> **NB:**

1. ` Do not push directly to the main branch.`

2. ` Do not merge your own pull request.`
